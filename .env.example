# - Use a `.env.local` for local development and `.env` / secret env vars configured in your CI/CD or hosting provider for production.
# - Keep `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and other secrets out of client-exposed variables (don't prefix them with NEXT_PUBLIC_)
# - After filling `.env.local`, restart the dev server so Next.js picks up changes.
