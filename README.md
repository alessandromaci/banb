# Overview

Banb (Blockchain Agent Neo Bank) is a decentralized banking application that merges the fintech neo-bankâ€™s ease of use functionality (payments, deposits, investments) with blockchain-native infrastructure and AI-driven automation.
It enables users to:
Manage a digital profile linked to blockchain wallets


* Send payments (crypto and fiat-like)
* Deposit and withdraw via third-party on/off-ramp providers
* Add invest accounts according to personalized risk profiles
* Use an AI agent to execute banking operations and craft transactions

The system is modular, mobile first, and designed to integrate both Web3 transaction logic (via wagmi/viem) and Web2 data persistence (via Supabase).
