# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration to enable AI-powered queries about user data within the Banb application. Users can ask natural language questions about their investments, transactions, balances, and other banking data through an MCP server that connects to OpenAI's API. 

## Glossary

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: A standardized protocol for connecting AI models to external data sources and tools
- **MCP Server**: A service that exposes application data and operations as tools that AI models can invoke
- **Query Tool**: An MCP tool that retrieves specific data from the application (read-only)
- **OpenAI API**: The external AI service used to process natural language queries
- **User Context**: The authenticated user's profile, balance, transactions, and investment data
- **AI Agent**: The existing chat-based AI assistant in the application

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask the AI about my available investment options, so that I can make informed decisions about where to invest my funds

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a query about investments, THE MCP Server SHALL retrieve available investment products from the application database
2. THE MCP Server SHALL format investment data including product names, risk levels, expected returns, and minimum investment amounts
3. THE OpenAI API SHALL process the query and return a natural language response using the investment data
4. THE AI Agent SHALL display the response in the chat interface within 5 seconds
5. WHERE the user is not authenticated, THE MCP Server SHALL return an error message indicating authentication is required

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to query my current balance and recent transactions, so that I can understand my financial position without navigating through multiple screens

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests balance information, THE MCP Server SHALL retrieve the current USDC balance from the user's wallet
2. WHEN a user requests transaction history, THE MCP Server SHALL retrieve the most recent 10 transactions from the database
3. THE MCP Server SHALL include transaction details such as amount, recipient, date, and status
4. THE OpenAI API SHALL summarize the financial data in a conversational format
5. THE AI Agent SHALL present the summary without exposing sensitive wallet addresses in full

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask about my recipients and payment history, so that I can quickly recall who I've paid and how much

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user queries about recipients, THE MCP Server SHALL retrieve all saved recipients for the user's profile
2. THE MCP Server SHALL include recipient names and total amounts sent to each recipient
3. WHEN a user asks about specific payment patterns, THE OpenAI API SHALL analyze transaction data and identify trends
4. THE AI Agent SHALL respond with insights such as most frequent recipients and average payment amounts
5. THE MCP Server SHALL limit data exposure to only the authenticated user's own data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to be easily configurable with an OpenAI API key, so that I can deploy the feature without complex setup

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE MCP Server SHALL read the OpenAI API key from the AI_API_KEY environment variable
2. WHEN the API key is missing or invalid, THE MCP Server SHALL return a clear error message to the client
3. THE MCP Server SHALL validate the API key format before making requests to OpenAI
4. THE Application SHALL provide documentation on how to configure the .env.local file with the API key
5. WHERE the AI_PROVIDER environment variable is not set to "openai", THE MCP Server SHALL log a warning but continue operation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to only access my data when I'm authenticated, so that my financial information remains secure

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE MCP Server SHALL verify user authentication before processing any query
2. WHEN an unauthenticated request is received, THE MCP Server SHALL reject the request with a 401 status code
3. THE MCP Server SHALL use the profile_id from the authenticated session to scope all data queries
4. THE MCP Server SHALL NOT expose data from other users' profiles
5. THE Application SHALL log all MCP query attempts for security audit purposes

### Requirement 6 (Optional - Future Enhancement)

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask the AI to perform actions like sending payments, so that I can complete transactions through natural language commands

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE action tools are enabled, THE MCP Server SHALL expose write operations such as payment creation
2. WHEN a user requests an action, THE AI Agent SHALL present a confirmation dialog before execution
3. THE MCP Server SHALL validate all action parameters before execution
4. THE Application SHALL require explicit user consent for each action operation
5. THE MCP Server SHALL log all action operations with full audit trail

### Requirement 7 (Optional - Future Enhancement)

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to provide investment recommendations based on my risk profile, so that I can receive personalized financial guidance

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE recommendation tools are enabled, THE MCP Server SHALL retrieve the user's risk profile from the database
2. THE OpenAI API SHALL analyze the user's transaction history and current portfolio
3. THE AI Agent SHALL generate personalized investment suggestions based on risk tolerance
4. THE Application SHALL display a disclaimer that recommendations are not financial advice
5. THE MCP Server SHALL update recommendations when the user's profile or portfolio changes significantly
